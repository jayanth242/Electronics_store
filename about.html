		<h2> About Us </h2>
		<div class="about-content">
			<p>A visionary entrepreneur with keen business savvy and foresight, Mr. Pawan Bajaj founded Bajaj Electronics in 1980 with the principle of providing quality and service to its guests.

				The awe-inspiring journey that began with a small electronics showroom at Lakidikapul in 1980, Bajaj Electronics has since evolved and has become the most trusted electronics retail chain in South India. We earned the trust of the locals and grew from strength to strength,  to what is now a chain of the most genuine electronic stores across Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, offering quality service at the best price. There are now 99 aesthetically designed and conveniently located showrooms in cities like Hyderabad, Vishakhapatnam, Nalgonda, Kurnool, Warangal, Tirupati, Vijayawada, Rajahmundry, and Guntur where you can shop for the latest in electronics.
				
				Our portfolio includes product lines that range from affordable & mass-market to luxurious and cater to every economic group. The portfolio of Bajaj Electronics includes all the leading electronic brands – LG, Panasonic, Sony, Oppo, Vivo, Dell, HP, OnePlus, Voltas, etc. to name a few.
